🚀 Automating Linux User Management Like a Pro
Showcase your sysadmin skills with this powerful Bash script!

🔗 Script Repository: GitHub Link (add your repo link)
💡 Why This Matters
In cloud/devops roles, efficiently managing users is critical for:
✅ Security (least privilege, audit trails)
✅ Automation (CI/CD service accounts)
✅ Compliance (password policies, access reviews)

Cloud Engineers: Secure IAM for Linux instances

📝 Usage Example
Scenario: Create a developer with SSH access

bash
Copy
sudo ./user_management.sh
1 → dev-alice → S3cur3P@ss! → y → developers → y → y → [PASTE_PUBKEY]
Outcome:

User created with:

Home directory (/home/dev-alice)

SSH key authentication

Membership in developers and sudo groups
